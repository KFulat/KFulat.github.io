For Diffusive Shock Acceleration electrons must have a highly suprathermal energy, implying a need for very efficient pre-acceleration. Most published studies consider a homogenous upstream medium, which is an unrealistic assumption for astrophysical environments. Using 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate electron acceleration and heating processes at high Mach-number shocks with a turbulent upstream medium. For this purpose slabs of plasma with compressive turbulence are separately simulated and then inserted into shock simulations, which requires matching of plasma slabs at the interface. Using a novel technique of matching electromagnetic fields and currents, we perform simulations of perpendicular shocks setting different intensities of density fluctuations (below 10%) in the upstream. We explore the impact of the fluctuations on electron heating, the dynamics of upstream electrons, and the driving of plasma instabilities. Our results indicate that while the presence of the turbulence enhances variations in the upstream magnetic field, their levels remain too low to influence significantly the behavior of electrons at perpendicular shocks. We extend our investigations to oblique shocks with a turbulent upstream medium, and discuss our latest results.","tags":[],"title":"PIC simulations of SNR shocks with a turbulent upstream medium","type":"event"},{"authors":["Paul J.

Observations of radio emission, non-thermal X-rays and high-energy gamma rays from supernova remnants (SNRs) suggest the efficient acceleration of electrons in these objects. The particles are thought to gain energy at collisionless and non-relativistic shock waves that form during supernova explosions. The primary acceleration mechanism is Diffusive Shock Acceleration, where particles gain energy by crossing a shock multiple times. However, the particles must have Larmor radii comparable to the shock width to be able to participate in this process. This means that electrons must be pre-accelerated to suprathermal energies, which is known as the electron injection problem.\nParticle dynamics in plasma is a complex phenomenon, and its study on electron kinetic scales requires the use of the particle-in-cell approach: first-principles simulations for collisionless plasma. Even with the power of modern supercomputers, these numerical experiments are computationally demanding.\nThe current focus of the project is on electron injection at oblique SNR shocks and the influence of pre-existing turbulence on electron dynamics at shocks. At oblique shocks, shock-reflected electrons form an extended region called the foreshock. They drive instabilities there, which leads to favourable conditions for efficient energy gain. The second part of the project involves studies of shocks propagating in turbulent media. We have found that pre-existing density fluctuations affect the physics of high-Mach-number shocks.\n","date":1654646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654646400,"objectID":"40287e28dc48a6dc47380fbc36c583c7","permalink":"https://KFulat.github.io/project/snr_shocks/","publishdate":"2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/snr_shocks/","section":"project","summary":"How electrons are energized at oblique shocks and how pre-existing turbulence influence conditions of the acceleration?","tags":["shocks","SNR","acceleration"],"title":"Electron acceleration at shocks in supernova remnants","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Radio relics are elongated synchrotron radio sources found in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. The relativistic electrons are thought to be accelerated at large-scale merger shocks, and are also considered to be possible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: they can have energies exceeding $E\u0026gt;10^{18} \\\\ \\text{eV}$. Particles are accelerated at shocks via Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), gaining energy while crossing a shock multiple times. This process only works from a certain initial energy, which is a more important constraint for electrons than for protons (ions) due to their smaller mass. This is known as the electron injection problem, and it is still a missing puzzle to complete the picture of DSA.\nThe aim of this project is to study the electron pre-acceleration conditions at galaxy clusters shocks using particle-in-cell simulations. This is the ab-intitio method for kinetic plasma theory, which resolves the microphysics of collisionless shocks. Current studies focus on Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration (SSDA): an efficient mechanism of electron pre-acceleration. It requires the presence of multiscale turbulence in the shock transition, including shock ripples (shock front corrugations).\n","date":165456e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":165456e4,"objectID":"30e5305b29aa75550e744e54f6d56769","permalink":"https://KFulat.github.io/project/cluster-shocks/","publishdate":"2022-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cluster-shocks/","section":"project","summary":"Study of the conditions for effective electron acceleration at low-Mach-number shocks","tags":["shocks"],"title":"Electron acceleration at shocks in merging galaxy clusters","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The stream of particles known as the solar wind spreads out within the heliosphere, creating shocks. These waves are collisionless, meaning that energy transfer between particles is via collective particle-waves interactions instead of binary Coulomb collisions. Interplanetary shocks (IP) originate from co-rotating interaction regions, areas where the fast solar wind rams into the slow one, and from coronal mass ejections, which are huge releases of solar plasma. The distribution function of the solar wind electrons is strongly influenced by these shocks. Suprathermal electrons have energies of about 70 eV to 2 keV and they follow the interplanetary magnetic field line as they propagate through the heliosphere. This means that their pitch-angle distributions contain information about the magnetic topology of the solar wind.\nThe project aimed to characterise and examine suprathermal electron populations associated with IP shocks. We used electron angle-angle distributions, measured in situ by the Cluster spacecrafts, during normal solar wind conditions, in the presence of whistler waves and during events associated with IP shocks. The shape of the distributions was examined using spectra of fitted spherical harmonics. This method is a quick way to characterise observed spectra and can be used for Solar Orbiter data, allowing us to study the evolution of the distributions during the propagation at an IP shock.\n","date":1654473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654473600,"objectID":"ba1f20aeda25d86f2ffafec415a3794e","permalink":"https://KFulat.github.io/project/electrons/","publishdate":"2022-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/electrons/","section":"project","summary":"How IP shocks affect the electron distribution function in the solar wind?","tags":["shocks","space physics","electrons"],"title":"Suprathermal electrons at interplanetary shocks","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1653413400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653413400,"objectID":"7e3af279e63d0be0f7fbbb19e73bd79f","permalink":"https://KFulat.github.io/talk/pic-simulations-of-snr-shock-waves-with-a-turbulent-upstream-medium/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pic-simulations-of-snr-shock-waves-with-a-turbulent-upstream-medium/","section":"event","summary":"Investigation of astrophysical shocks has a major importance in understanding physics of the cosmic rays acceleration.
