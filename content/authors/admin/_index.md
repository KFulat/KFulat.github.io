#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the group of
Prof. Ellen Zweibel. I am also a member of Simons Collaboration on Extreme Electrodynamics of Compact Sources (SCEECS).
My main interests revolve around investigating fundametal processes at the origin of the observed radiative and particle
spectra from various astrophysical sources. I employ fully kinetic plasma simulations to explore the microphysics of
these complex phenomena. My current focus is on extreme plasmas associated with compact objects and their
environments.
