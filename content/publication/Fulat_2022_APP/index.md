abstract: <div style='text-align: justify;'> Investigation of astrophysical shocks has major importance in understanding the physics of the cosmic rays acceleration. Electrons to be accelerated at shocks must have suprathermal energy, which implies that they should undergo some pre-acceleration mechanism. Many numerical studies examined possible injection mechanisms, however, most of them considered homogenous upstream medium, which is an unreal assumption for astrophysical environments. We will investigate electron acceleration at high Mach number and low plasma beta shocks using a 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations with a turbulent upstream medium. Here, we discuss a method of generation of the compression-dominated turbulence. It is sufficiently long-living to be inserted into a shock simulation and its parameters represent the high Mach number and low beta regime. </div>
