abstract: Strong nonrelativistic shocks are known to accelerate particles up to relativistic energies. However, for diffusive shock acceleration, electrons must have a highly suprathermal energy, implying the need for very efﬁcient preacceleration. Most published studies consider shocks propagating through homogeneous plasma, which is an unrealistic assumption for astrophysical environments. Using 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate electron acceleration and heating processes at nonrelativistic high-Mach-number shocks in electron-ion plasma with a turbulent upstream medium. For this purpose, slabs of plasma with compressive turbulence are simulated separately and then inserted into shock simulations, which require matching of the plasma slabs at the interface. Using a novel procedure of matching electromagnetic ﬁelds and currents, we perform simulations of perpendicular shocks setting different intensities of density ﬂuctuations (<10%) in the upstream region. The new simulation technique provides a framework for studying shocks propagating in turbulent media. We explore the impact of the ﬂuctuations on electron heating, the dynamics of upstream electrons, and the driving of plasma instabilities. Our results indicate that while the presence of turbulence enhances variations in the upstream magnetic ﬁeld, their levels remain too low to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the behavior of electrons at perpendicular shocks.
