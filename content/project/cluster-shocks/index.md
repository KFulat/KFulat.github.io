In this thesis we investigate conditions for effective electron injection at low Mach number
galaxy cluster shocks. In particular, we discuss the effects of multi-scale magnetic field turbu-
lence at the shock, that includes the shock surface rippling. We study the role of the rippling in
the electron pre-acceleration to DSA. The main tool used in this study is a numerical technique
of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which is an ab-intitio method for collisionless plasma.
