Radio synchrotron emission in radio relics is a signature of relativistic electrons. They are thought to be accelerated at large-scale shocks of merging galaxy clusters, and are also considered to be possible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: they can have energies exceeding $E>10^{18} \\ \text{eV}$.<br/><br/>

Particles are accelerated at shocks via Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), gaining energy while crossing a shock multiple times. This process works only from a certain initial energy, which is a more important constraint for electrons than for ions due to their smaller masses. This is known as the electron injection problem and it is a missing puzzle to complete the picture of DSA.<br/><br/>

The goal of this project is to study the electron acceleration conditions at galaxy clusters shock via particle-in-cell simulations. This is the ab-intitio method for kinetic plasma theory, which resolves the microphysics of collisionless shocks. Current studies focus on Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration (SSDA): an efficient mechanism of electron pre-acceleration. It requires the presence of multiscale turbulence in the shock transition.
