Radio relics are elongated synchrotron radio sources found in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. The relativistic electrons are thought to be accelerated at large-scale merger shocks, and are also considered to be possible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: they can have energies exceeding $E>10^{18} \\ \text{eV}$.<br/><br/>

Particles are accelerated at shocks via Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), gaining energy while crossing a shock multiple times. This process only works from a certain initial energy, which is a more important constraint for electrons than for protons (ions) due to their smaller mass. This is known as the electron injection problem, and it is still a missing puzzle to complete the picture of DSA.<br/><br/>

The aim of this project is to study the electron pre-acceleration conditions at galaxy clusters shocks using particle-in-cell simulations. This is the ab-intitio method for kinetic plasma theory, which resolves the microphysics of collisionless shocks. Current studies focus on Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration (SSDA): an efficient mechanism of electron pre-acceleration. It requires the presence of multiscale turbulence in the shock transition, including shock ripples (shock front corrugations).
