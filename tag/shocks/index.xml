The origin and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays, the energetic charged particles that reach the Earth's surface, are still an open question in modern astrophysics. Observations of radio emission, non-thermal X-rays and high-energy gamma rays from supernova remnants (SNRs) suggest the efficient acceleration of electrons in these objects. The particles are thought to gain energy at collisionless and non-relativistic shock waves that form during supernova explosions.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
&lt;p>The primary acceleration mechanism is Diffusive Shock Acceleration, where particles gain energy by crossing a shock multiple times. However, the particles must have Larmor radii comparable to the shock width to be able to participate in this process. This means that electrons must be pre-accelerated to suprathermal energies, which is known as the electron injection problem.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Particle dynamics in plasma is a complex phenomenon, and its study on electron kinetic scales requires the use of the particle-in-cell approach: first-principles simulations for collisionless plasma. Even with the power of modern supercomputers, these numerical experiments are computationally demanding.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current focus of the project is on electron injection at oblique SNR shocks and the influence of pre-existing turbulence on electron dynamics at shocks. At oblique shocks, shock-reflected electrons form an extended region called the foreshock. They drive instabilities there, which leads to favourable conditions for efficient energy gain. The second part of the project involves studies of shocks propagating in turbulent media. We have found that pre-existing density fluctuations affect the physics of high-Mach-number shocks.&lt;/p>

Radio synchrotron emission in radio relics is a signature of relativistic electrons. They are thought to be accelerated at large-scale shocks of merging galaxy clusters, and are also considered to be possible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: they can have energies exceeding $E>10^{18} \\ \text{eV}$.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
&lt;p>Particles are accelerated at shocks via Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), gaining energy while crossing a shock multiple times. This process works only from a certain initial energy, which is a more important constraint for electrons than for ions due to their smaller masses. This is known as the electron injection problem and it is a missing puzzle to complete the picture of DSA.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of this project is to study the electron acceleration conditions at galaxy clusters shock via particle-in-cell simulations. This is the ab-intitio method for kinetic plasma theory, which resolves the microphysics of collisionless shocks. Current studies focus on Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration (SSDA): an efficient mechanism of electron pre-acceleration. It requires the presence of multiscale turbulence in the shock transition.&lt;/p>

The stream of particles known as the solar wind spreads out within the heliosphere, creating shocks. These waves are collisionless, meaning that energy transfer between particles is via collective particle-waves interactions instead of binary Coulomb collisions. Interplanetary shocks (IP) originate from co-rotating interaction regions, areas where the fast solar wind rams into the slow one, and from coronal mass ejections, which are huge releases of solar plasma. The distribution function of the solar wind electrons is strongly influenced by these shocks.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
&lt;p>Suprathermal electrons have energies of about 70 eV to 2 keV and they follow the interplanetary magnetic field line as they propagate through the heliosphere. This means that their pitch-angle distributions contain information about the magnetic topology of the solar wind.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project aimed to characterise and examine suprathermal electron populations associated with IP shocks. We used electron angle-angle distributions, measured in situ by the Cluster spacecrafts, during normal solar wind conditions, in the presence of whistler waves and during events associated with IP shocks. The shape of the distributions was examined using spectra of fitted spherical harmonics. This method is a quick way to characterise observed spectra and can be used for Solar Orbiter data, allowing us to study the evolution of the distributions during the propagation at an IP shock.&lt;/p>
